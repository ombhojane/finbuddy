Each song is a large file, and the company wants to store all these files on a cluster of servers so they can be easily accessed by users.\n\nHadoop's Distributed File System (HDFS) solves this problem by dividing each large file into smaller chunks (called blocks), typically 64MB or 128MB in size. These blocks are then stored across multiple machines in the cluster, making sure that no single machine holds the entire dataset.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a song file called \"Happy_Birthday.mp3\" that's 100MB in size. HDFS would divide this file into 4 blocks of 25MB each and store them on different machines in the cluster. This way, even if one machine fails, the data can still be retrieved from other nodes.\n\n**Redundancy and Fault Tolerance**\n\nTo ensure that data is not lost in case of a machine failure, HDFS replicates each block across multiple nodes (usually 3 copies by default). So, in our example, each of the 4 blocks would have 2 additional copies on different machines. This way, even if one machine fails, we can still access the song file from other nodes.\n\n**Parallel Processing with MapReduce**\n\nNow that we have our data stored across multiple machines, let's say we want to analyze user listening habits based on their favorite songs. We can use Hadoop's MapReduce framework to process this data in parallel across multiple nodes.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Map Phase**: In the map phase, each node processes a subset of the data and breaks down the song files into key-value pairs (e.g., \"song_id\" -> \"artist_name\"). This process filters and organizes the data.\n2. **Reduce Phase**: In the reduce phase, the key-value pairs from the map phase are grouped and aggregated to produce a final result (e.g., \"artist_name\" -> \"total_listens\").\n\nFor example, let's say we have 100 nodes processing this data in parallel. Each node would process a subset of the song files and break them down into key-value pairs. The reduce phase would then combine these results across all nodes to produce a final result showing which artists are most popular among users.\n\n**Resource Management with YARN**\n\nAs our music streaming service grows, we need to manage resources effectively to ensure that multiple jobs can run simultaneously without interference. This is where YARN comes in \u2013 it's responsible for managing cluster resources and scheduling jobs.\n\nFor example, let's say we have two jobs running concurrently: one job is processing user listening habits (as described above), while another job is generating recommendations based on user preferences. YARN would allocate CPU, memory, and other resources to each task, ensuring that both jobs can run smoothly without interfering with each other.\n\nI hope this example helps illustrate how Hadoop addresses big data challenges!", "timestamp": "2024-12-31T22:11:41.240136"}, "7": {"pdf_id": "BDA_M1_1.

It has a manageable volume, is easy to manage and manipulate, and its sources include ERP transaction data, CRM transaction data, financial data, organizational data, web transaction data, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, big data refers to unstructured or semi-structured data that is generated outside the enterprise level. Its volume is huge and becomes unmanageable, it's difficult to manage and manipulate, and its sources include social media, device data, sensor data, video, images, audio, etc.\n\n**Real-life Example**\n\nHere are some real-life examples to illustrate the difference:\n\n* **Traditional Data**: A retail company like Walmart generates traditional data from their daily sales transactions, customer information, and inventory management. This data is structured, stable, and manageable.\n* **Big Data**: In contrast, a social media platform like Facebook generates big data from user interactions, posts, comments, likes, shares, etc. This data is unstructured, dynamic, and difficult to manage.\n\nIn the case of Walmart, their traditional data can be easily stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS) like Oracle or MySQL. However, for Facebook, their big data requires specialized tools like Hadoop, MongoDB, or NoSQL databases to handle its massive volume, velocity, and variety.\n\nI hope this example helps clarify the difference between traditional data and big data!", "timestamp": "2025-01-05T00:17:14.952576"}, "10": {"pdf_id": "NLP_M3_2.
